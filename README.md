### Welcome 👋👋👋


- 👋 Hello there! I'm Luke Skinner 
- 🌱 I am currently learning how to write my own programming language, and how to better my web dev skills.
- 💼 I am a Software Developer at KMsoft working on inventory/stock management software solutions in a variety of areas. The main two focusing on Medical and Industrial.
- 👨‍🎓 I am Graduate from Uni of Stirling. BSc (Hons) Software Development with Cyber Security. You can check out my portfolio at [portfolio.ljskinner.com](https://portfolio.ljskinner.com/)
- 👨‍💻 I am collaborating with my good friend [Andrew McGuckin](https://github.com/AndrewMcGuckin) on [Project Roundtable](https://github.com/Project-Roundtable) projects. We are currently working on a degree classification and grade calculator for fellow Uni of Stirling students.
- 🧳 I am also working on maintaining a modification made for the popular game [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us) called [The Emerald Lasso](https://github.com/LJSkinner/The-Emerald-Lasso) written in Java and hosted on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-emerald-lasso) for other people to use and play with.
- 📫 How to reach me: ljs.work@pm.me
- ⚡ Fun fact: [Project Roundtable](https://github.com/Project-Roundtable) was originally going to be a Uni society/club, but we got too busy with our dissertations.
